    "title": "Measuring Stereotypes using Entity-Centric Data",
    "authors": "Navid Madani, Rabiraj Bandyopadhyay, Michael Miller Yoder, Kenneth Joseph",
    "conference": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.09548 (2023)",
    "abstract": "Stereotypes inform how we present ourselves and others, and in turn how we behave. They are thus important to measure. Recent work has used projections of embeddings from Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs), such as BERT, to perform these measurements. However, DSMs capture cognitive associations that are not necessarily relevant to the interpersonal nature of stereotyping. Here, we propose and evaluate three novel, entity-centric methods for learning stereotypes from Twitter and Wikipedia biographies. Models are trained by leveraging the fact that multiple phrases are applied to the same person, magnifying the person-centric nature of the learned associations. We show that these models outperform existing approaches to stereotype measurement with respect to 1) predicting which identities people apply to themselves and others, and 2) quantifying stereotypes on salient social dimensions (e.g. gender). Via a case study, we also show the utility of these models for future questions in computational social science.",

    "authors": "Navid Madani, Kenneth Joseph",
    "conference": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.02206 (2023)",
    "abstract": "Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural language questions over a knowledge graph (KG). This task requires a model to reason over multiple edges of the KG to reach the right answer. In this work, we present a method to equip large language models (LLMs) with classic logical programming languages to provide an explainable solution to the problem. Our goal is to extract the representation of the question in the form of a Prolog query, which can then be used to answer the query programmatically. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we use the MetaQA dataset and show that our method finds the correct answer entities for all the questions in the test dataset.",

    "title": "Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics: Applications to Property Inference",
    "authors": "Michael Sullivan",
    "conference": "",
    "abstract": "In this extended abstract, I propose the Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics (FoLDS) model, which generates complex-valued word vectors drawn from a fuzzy-logical model world imperatively constructed from logical-form rep- resentations of sentences from Simple English Wikipedia articles. A complex-valued similarity metric arises nat- urally from complex-valued embeddings, which permits FoLDS to leverage multiple axes of similarity simultane- ously (antonymy/synonymy and relatedness). Moreover, I ar- gue that using a rule-based parser to translate sentences into logical forms has a syntactic de-noising effect on the result- ing embeddings, which allows FoLDS to effectively lever- age a smaller training corpus. I show that FoLDS is able to achieve near-state-of-the-art results (within 10%) on a prop- erty inference task despite using word embeddings obtained from a corpus approximately two hundred times smaller than the training corpora that competing approaches use.",

    "abstract": "Our work presents a system for modeling collective decision-making in an interpretable way. We identify two paradigms of collective decision-making: independent, where decision-makers do not influence each other, and collaborative, where they do. Our system provides a unified approach for handling both scenarios, drawing inspiration from conventional collaborative filtering approaches used in recommendation systems research. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted experiments on two datasets: one consisting of conversational data between a chatbot and a human, and the other containing tweets related to three topics (Covid-19, BLM, and Trump 2020).  We also discuss the system's potential applications and directions for future research.",

    "title": "Dialo-AP: A Dependency Parsing Based Argument Parser for Dialogues",
    "authors": "Sougata Saha, Souvik Das, Rohini Srihari",
    "conference": "Coling 2022",
    "abstract": "While neural approaches to argument mining (AM) have advanced considerably, most of the recent work has been limited to parsing monologues. With an urgent interest in the use of conversational agents for broader societal applications, there is a need to advance the state-of-the-art in argument parsers for dialogues. This enables progress towards more purposeful conversations involving persuasion, debate and deliberation. This paper discusses Dialo-AP, an end-to-end argument parser that constructs argument graphs from dialogues. We formulate AM as dependency parsing of elementary and argumentative discourse units; the system is trained using extensive pre-training and curriculum learning comprising nine diverse corpora. Dialo-AP is capable of generating argument graphs from dialogues by performing all sub-tasks of AM. Compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines, Dialo-AP achieves significant improvements across all tasks, which is further validated through rigorous human evaluation.",

    "authors": "Sougata Saha, Souvik Das, Rohini Srihari",
    "conference": "SIGDIAL 2022",
    "abstract": "Neural approaches to end-to-end argument mining (AM) are often formulated as dependency parsing (DP), which relies on token-level sequence labeling and intricate post-processing for extracting argumentative structures from text. Although such methods yield reasonable results, operating solely with tokens increases the possibility of discontinuous and overly segmented structures due to minor inconsistencies in token level predictions. In this paper, we propose EDU-AP, an end-to-end argument parser, that alleviates such problems in dependency-based methods by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between elementary discourse units (EDUs) and argumentative discourse units (ADUs) and operates at both token and EDU level granularity. Further, appropriately using contextual information, along with optimizing a novel objective function during training, EDU-AP achieves significant improvements across all four tasks of AM compared to existing dependency-based methods.",

    "authors": "Souvik Das, Sougata Saha, Rohini K. Srihari",
    "conference": "Coling 2022",
    "abstract": "Personalized response selection systems are generally grounded on persona. However, a correlation exists between persona and empathy, which these systems do not explore well. Also, when a contradictory or off-topic response is selected, faithfulness to the conversation context plunges. This paper attempts to address these issues by proposing a suite of fusion strategies that capture the interaction between persona, emotion, and entailment information of the utterances. Ablation studies on the Persona-Chat dataset show that incorporating emotion and entailment improves the accuracy of response selection. We combine our fusion strategies and concept-flow encoding to train a BERT-based model which outperforms the previous methods by margins larger than 2.3% on original personas and 1.9% on revised personas in terms of hits@1 (top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the Persona-Chat dataset",

    "conference": "Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on NLP for Conversational AI @ ACL 2022.",
    "abstract": "Personality traits influence human actions and thoughts, which is manifested in day to day conversations. Although glimpses of personality traits are observable in existing open domain conversation corpora, leveraging generic language modelling for response generation overlooks the interlocutor idiosyncrasies, resulting in non-customizable personality agnostic responses. With the motivation of enabling stylistically configurable response generators, in this paper we experiment with end-to-end mechanisms to ground neural response generators based on both (i) interlocutor Big-5 personality traits, and (ii) discourse intent as stylistic control codes. Since most of the existing large scale open domain chat corpora do not include Big-5 personality traits and discourse intent, we employ automatic annotation schemes to enrich the corpora with noisy estimates of personality and intent annotations, and further assess the impact of using such features as control codes for response generation using automatic evaluation metrics, ablation studies and human judgement. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of this strategy resulting in improvements to existing benchmarks. Additionally, we yield two silver standard annotated corpora with intents and personality traits annotated, which can be of use to the research community.",

We have explored different methods and models for binary classification, multi-class classification and named entity recognition (NER) for these tasks. We have also processed the provided dataset for noise, imbalance, and creative language expression from data. Using diverse NLP methods we classified tweets for mentions of adverse drug effects (ADEs) and self-reporting the exact age in the tweets. Further, extracted reactions from the tweets and normalized these adverse effects to a standard concept ID in the MedDRA vocabulary.",

The dataset contains 236,336 academic full-text articles as of July 19, 2021. This paper introduces a web-based system to handle user questions over the Coronavirus full-text scholarly articles. The system periodically runs backend services to process such large amount article with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that include tokenization, N-Grams extraction, and part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. It automatically identifies the keywords from the question and uses cosine similarity to summarize the associated content and present to the user. This research will possibly benefit researchers, health workers as well as other individuals. Moreover, the same service can be used to train with the datasets of different domains (e.g., education) to generate a relevant summary for other user groups (e.g., students).",

    "abstract": "Twitter users signal social identity in their profile descriptions, or bios, in a number of important but complex ways that are not well-captured by existing characterizations of how identity is expressed in language. Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we identify and define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our work opens up exciting new opportunities at the intersection between the social psychological study of social identity and the study of how we compose the self through markers of identity on Twitter and in social media more generally.",

    "conference": "Arxiv Preprint 2021",
    "abstract": "Generative neural conversational systems are generally trained with the objective of minimizing the entropy loss between the training 'hard' targets and the predicted logits. Often, performance gains and improved generalization can be achieved by using regularization techniques like label smoothing, which converts the training 'hard' targets to 'soft' targets. However, label smoothing enforces a data independent uniform distribution on the incorrect training targets, which leads to an incorrect assumption of equi-probable incorrect targets for each correct target. In this paper we propose and experiment with incorporating data dependent word similarity based weighing methods to transforms the uniform distribution of the incorrect target probabilities in label smoothing, to a more natural distribution based on semantics. We introduce hyperparameters to control the incorrect target distribution, and report significant performance gains over networks trained using standard label smoothing based loss, on two standard open domain dialogue corpora.",
